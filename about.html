      <h2>BIOGRAPHY</h2>
      <div class="six columns subhead">Passionate about Computer Science, Mathematics and creative pursuits of all kinds.</div>
    </div>
    <p>I'm an inquisitive college student currently attending 
    <a href = "https://www.northeastern.edu/">Northeastern University</a>'s
    Honors College in Boston, Massachusetts to attain a dual degree in 
    Computer Science and Mathematics. </p>
  </div>

  <div class="six columns">
    <p>Born and raised in Portland, Oregon, 
    I discovered problem solving through FIRST Lego League and First Tech Challenge - 
    then discovered multithreading, graph theory and Linux, participating in local 
    internships and research experiences before pursuing higher education on the east coast.</p>
    <p>When I'm not re-ricing a linux distribution or analyzing networks,
    you can find me photographing friends, honing my style, or sharing the music I enjoy. </p>

    <h2>
    Experiences
    </h2>
    
    <h6>Urban Informatics Lab</h6>
    <p>I'm currently performing data analytics for Northeastern's Urban Informatics Laboratory at Northeastern University
    under professor Ryan Qi Wang - analyzing the mobility of individuals and businesses over time, especially as impacted 
    by natural disasters and social class circumstances. I've analyzed Google Places data for all major US cities,
    consolidating information and grouping places by relative location, even without clearly distinguishing factors.</p>
    
    <h6>CDK Global: Web Development Intern</h6>
    <p>At CDK Global, I lead the development of an internally facing React & Redux application to analyze credit inquiry frequency 
    statistics from customers (Car Dealerships). Utilizing Agile/Scrum techniques through Atlassian's Jira, Confluence and Stash, 
    as well as a React/SpringBoot/PostGreSQL stack, we successfully deployed builds through Bamboo to meet the credit reporting team's needs.</p>

    <h6>Portland State University: High School Apprenticeship Program</h6>
    <p>At Portland State, I partnered with other high school students, as well as graduate students and professors,
    to develop knowledge of linear algebra concepts, then apply them to develop 
    <a href = "https://github.com/PDX-Math-HSAP/cpp_code">graph algorithms</a> used to process large datasets.</p>
